# cctv

install 汉仪综艺体简 Futura Arial MSYH fonts first

and type https://HittyGubby.github.io/CCTV_webui to your obs browser source

and yay

and you can click to edit text and it remembers

o and a major downside: IMEs like fcitx wont trigger on OBS browser windows since obs doesnt expose that, so pretty much u have to copypaste for ime langs

### bs

uh, i was streaming in a random group and found mimicing tv ui funny

so spent like 3hrs to replicate the exact same ticker+logo for cctv (not your domestic webcam though)

so pretty useful if u are someone wanna staying cool by branding yourself the director

and especially if u actually watch cctv and be like WTF why would you watch cctv
